response:
Anya Petrova was born in the small, isolated village of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains. Oakhaven was known for its skilled woodcarvers, and Anya's family were among the most renowned. Her father, Dimitri, crafted intricate figures of forest spirits and mythical beasts, while her mother, Irina, specialized in practical, yet beautiful, furniture. Anya grew up surrounded by the scent of wood shavings and the rhythmic tap of chisels.

However, Oakhaven wasn't entirely peaceful. The village paid a yearly tribute to the local griffin, Vorlag, to prevent it from raiding their livestock. This tribute was usually a prized sheep or a young bull, but one year, Vorlag demanded a human offering – a young woman of marriageable age. Anya, at sixteen, was chosen by lot.

Rather than accepting her fate passively, Anya pleaded with her father to craft her a special weapon – a bow made from the heartwood of a whispering willow, said to be imbued with the spirit of the forest. Dimitri reluctantly agreed, pouring all his skill and grief into the creation. Anya trained relentlessly, learning to shoot with a speed and accuracy that surprised even her father.

When the day came to offer herself to Vorlag, Anya didn't go meekly. She faced the griffin, bow in hand, and fired a single arrow. It struck Vorlag in the eye, blinding it and sending it crashing into the mountainside. 

The villagers hailed her as a hero, but Anya felt a restlessness within her. She had proven her strength, but Oakhaven felt small now. She left the village shortly after, seeking adventure and a way to hone her skills, determined to never be a victim again.

This background gives Anya a strong connection to nature, a skill with a bow, and a driving motivation to prove herself. It also sets her up for potential conflicts – perhaps Vorlag's kin seek revenge, or she encounters others who underestimate her because of her humble origins.

**Planner's Plan:**
Okay, the player is a developer testing the `CharacterCreationWorkflow`. They want me to initiate it directly, and then ask *them* for input. They specifically want me to avoid using any other tools or doing anything extra. This is a pretty straightforward request.

The player wants to test the character creation workflow. The current state is that it's the first turn, and no character exists yet. The player has given me permission to directly call the `CharacterCreationWorkflow` and then ask for input.

My plan is to call the `CharacterCreationWorkflow` and have it start the character creation process. The workflow will likely ask the player a series of questions to define their character.

I have enough information to proceed. The next step is to initiate the `CharacterCreationWorkflow` and ask the player for their first input.

Since this is the first turn, and the player has given a simple greeting, I think the best course of action is to initiate world creation. The `WorldCreatorAgent` can help us establish a setting and a starting point. We can then refine the world based on the player's feedback.

**Final Action:**

Ask the player: "Hello! Welcome to our D&D game. To start, what kind of world would you like to adventure in? Some ideas are: a classic high fantasy realm, a gritty steampunk city, a mysterious jungle temple, or a dark and gothic castle. Or, tell me your own idea!"

character_name: Elara Meadowlight
character_description: Elara is a half-elf druid with a deep connection to the forest. She has long, flowing auburn hair woven with leaves and flowers, and bright green eyes that seem to hold the wisdom of ages. She prefers simple, practical clothing made from natural fibers, and carries a staff carved from a living branch. She is kind and compassionate, but fiercely protective of the natural world.
character_backstory: Elara grew up in a secluded grove, raised by her elven mother and human father. She learned the ways of the druids from her mother, and the practicality of human life from her father. She left the grove to explore the world and help protect the forests from encroaching civilization.
character_personality: Elara is a quiet observer, preferring to listen and learn before speaking. She is patient and understanding, but can be fierce when angered, especially if the forest is threatened. She has a deep love for all living things, and often talks to animals and plants as if they were old friends.
character_appearance: Elara is of average height for a half-elf, with a lithe and graceful build. She has a smattering of freckles across her nose and cheeks, and her skin is tanned from years spent outdoors. She wears a simple leather tunic and trousers, with a cloak woven from leaves and vines.
character_skills: Elara is skilled in herbalism, shapeshifting, and nature magic. She can communicate with animals, and has a knack for finding her way through the wilderness.
character_flaws: Elara can be overly trusting, and sometimes underestimates the greed and cruelty of humans. She also has a tendency to get lost in thought, and can be slow to react in dangerous situations.
character_goal: Elara's goal is to protect the forests of the world from destruction, and to help maintain the balance between civilization and nature.
character_relationships: Elara has a close relationship with her parents, and often visits them in their secluded grove. She is also friendly with many of the animals and plants she encounters on her travels.
character_quirks: Elara often hums to herself while she walks, and has a habit of collecting interesting stones and feathers. She also tends to apologize to trees when she accidentally bumps into them.
character_strengths: Elara's strengths lie in her connection to nature, her magical abilities, and her compassionate heart. She is a skilled healer, and a powerful protector of the forest.
character_weaknesses: Elara's weaknesses include her trusting nature, her tendency to get lost in thought, and her sometimes slow reaction time. She is also vulnerable to fire, as many forests are.
character_equipment: Elara carries a staff carved from a living branch, a pouch of healing herbs, a waterskin, and a small knife.
character_notes: Elara is a versatile character who can be used in a variety of settings. She is a good choice for players who enjoy playing supportive roles, but can also hold her own in a fight when necessary.
task: Expand on Elara's backstory, adding details about a specific event that shaped her worldview.

Since the player is taking the lead on debugging the callback issue, I don't need to actively *do* anything right now. I can simply acknowledge their progress and wait for their next instruction. A little bit of narrative flavor to keep things flowing is good, though.

I'll offer a small, open-ended question to keep the conversation going, but it's not critical. It's just a way to bridge the gap until the player finishes debugging and wants to continue the adventure.

Since the player is taking the lead on debugging the callback issue, I don't need to actively *do* anything right now. I can simply acknowledge their progress and wait for their next instruction. A little bit of narrative flavor to keep things flowing is good, though.

I'll offer a small, open-ended question to keep the conversation going, but it's not critical. It's just a way to bridge the gap until the player finishes debugging and wants to continue the adventure.

**Final Action:**
I will respond to the player with a brief acknowledgement and a light, conversational question.

This is a perfectly reasonable and proportional response to the player's statement that they're returning to the code. It doesn't assume anything about the player's intent, and it keeps the narrative flowing without being overly assertive. The Planner's proposed action is a good one. I don't need to call any tools; a simple narrative response is sufficient.

**Planner's Plan:**
Okay, the player has confirmed that the frontend auto-scrolling is working as expected. They are now going to return to the code to investigate the callback issue with the character creation workflow. This means our current task – testing the auto-scrolling – is complete.
